CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IN TRANSITION AND DEVELOPING
ECONOMIES: A CASE STUDY OF GHANA∗∗∗∗
Robert W. McGee
Florida International University
ABSTRACT
The World Bank has published a series of reports on corporate governance as part of its project
on the Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC). The corporate governance
principles in its ROSC Reports are benchmarked against the OECD’s Principles of Corporate
Governance (OECD 2004). The main categories of principles are discussed below. This study
focuses on the main corporate governance attributes of Ghana. The paper concludes with an
extensive bibliography.
INTRODUCTION
Corporate governance issues are especially important in transition economies, since these
countries do not have the long-established financial institution infrastructure to deal with
corporate governance issues. Before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet
Union, there was no need to discuss corporate governance issues because all enterprises were
owned by the state and there were no shareholders. All that has changed since 1989. This study
discusses in general how transition economies are dealing with corporate governance issues and
the extra obstacles they have to overcome due to a lack of established financial institution
infrastructure, then focuses on the main corporate governance issues in a particular country.
Corporate governance has become an important topic in transition economies in recent
years. Directors, owners and corporate managers have started to realize that there are benefits
that can accrue from having a good corporate governance structure. Good corporate governance

RECOMMENDATIONS
The ROSC Report made several recommendations. They centered on the following broad areas:
• Overhaul the institutional framework,
• Continue the legislative review and modernization,
• Increase awareness of corporate governance issues.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) needs to be strengthened in order to become
compliant with IOSCO requirements. It should have a separate enforcement department to focus on the
SEC monitoring efforts. SEC personnel need more training. There needs to be more transparency.
Speedier dispute resolution is needed in the High Court and that process has started. However, its
expertise and specialization need to be addressed. There is a new Commercial Court but it needs to
demonstrate improvement in functioning. More training and resources are needed and there should be
monitoring for quality. Private arbitration should be co0nsidered as an alternative to the official dispute
resolution mechanism.
A central registry system needs to be developed for equities. The SEC should assert jurisdiction
over the registry system. A clearance system for brokers would accelerate the processing of share trades.
The governance of state owned enterprises (SOE) needs to be improved. The capital markets laws
are being reformed and the ROSC urged the continuation of the reforms. The Companies Code needs to
be updated in order to be harmonized with SEC regulations. There are two codes on mergers and they
need to be harmonized.
The board representation and nomination process needs to be improved. Related party
transactions need to be regulated or prohibited based on international best practices. Disclosure rules for
beneficial ownership need to be adopted. There is a regulatory vacuum in some areas.
Ghana should promote director and executive training. There should be increased awareness and
more institutional investor activism.
