ABSTRACT
This research examines corporate governance disclosure in Nigerian and South African Banks
using the un-weighted disclosure index technique. This research provides a cross sectional
examination of corporate governance disclosure practices in the annual reports of 10 listed banks
in Nigeria and South Africa for the year 2013. The results suggest that Nigerian and South African
banks have a high level corporate governance disclosure. However, Nigeria and South African
banks have low levels of voluntary corporate governance disclosure. Furthermore, in reporting of
voluntary corporate governance disclosure, Nigerian banks appear to be collating information with
no link to the overall business strategy of the organization while the South African banks have a
more robust approach to voluntary corporate governance disclosure as they apply international
guidelines such as the global reporting initiative in reporting voluntary corporate governance
disclosure.

1. INTRODUCTION
Corporate governance disclosure is crucial for
the functioning of an effective and efficient
financial market [1,2]. The timeliness, adequacy
and availability of appropriate information about
financial and market securities are critical for
both market confidence and pricing efficiency [2].
For investors to make critical decision and sound
judgements on the value of market securities,
they need to be well informed of the relevant
facts [3]. Information disclosure is considered an
important element that is needed for the effective
operation of financial and security markets.
Presently, regulators are increasingly disturbed
about the quality of both financial and non-
financial information disclosure of firms in both
developed and developing countries [4].
There is an enormous disparity in the volume of
corporate governance disclosure research in
countries with developed capital markets when
compared to countries with less developed
capital markets. In countries with developed
capital market and effective legal/regulatory
frameworks, a significant amount of research on
corporate governance disclosure has been
executed [5]. Unfortunately, this is not the case
with countries with less developed markets. In
less developed countries, there is a paucity of
research on corporate governance disclosure; in
all sincerity, this should not be so [6,7,8]. In
comparison with corporate governance
disclosure in developed countries; in developing
countries, there are generally lower disclosure
standards, weaker regulatory and legal systems
as well as limited enforcement capacity [9,10];
there is significant state ownership or holding of
many private business corporations in
developing countries [11] and board
effectiveness and independence tends to be
weak and ineffective [12].
From the onset, the intention of this research
was to select the some of the best banks in
Africa to examine their corporate governance
disclosure practices, as larger banks are known
to have better disclosure practices than smaller
banks, since corporate governance disclosure
tends to generate considerable costs to firms.
More importantly, the research intends to
examine the current state of corporate
governance disclosure practices in Nigerian and
South Africa so as to understand and inform on
the nature, focus and extent of corporate
governance disclosure in Nigerian and South
African banking industry. This will inform to what
extent corporate governance disclosure in
Nigerian and South African banks are similar and
different, and if there are differences, what
exactly are the differences. The research
questions this paper intends to address is to
what extent do Nigerian and South African banks
disclose corporate governance information in
their annual report, is there any difference in the
level of corporate governance information
disclosed in their annual reports between these
two countries? Secondly, do they disclose more
corporate governance information than existing
regulations require? This paper intends to
contribute to the burgeoning research on
corporate governance disclosure in developing
countries with particular emphasis on South
African and Nigerian Banks.
2. AGENCY THEORY
In corporate governance research, agency theory
has been used to investigate corporate
governance disclosure [13,14,2]. The basic
assumption about of the agency theory is that
managers (agents) and the owners (principals)
interest are not aligned [15]. The managers or
directors are more interested in maximizing their
own wealth, power and prestige while
safeguarding their reputation; on the other hand
shareholders are more inclined to maximize the
value of their shares and asset holdings [16].
This divergence in the alignment of interest has
been the cause of severe tension between
agents and principals. [17] posit that these
divergences of interest could sometimes lead to
what they call ‘agency loss.’ Agency loss may
occur when the returns to the residual claimants
(the owners) falls short or below what they would
be if the principals, the owners exercise direct
control of the corporation [18].
According to the agency theory, in a bid to
address these tensions and resolve the
differences, the principals have developed a
number of policy incentives that seek to align the
interest of agents alongside theirs [19]. Some of
the policy prescriptions include: Incentive
schemes for managers which recompense them
monetarily for enhancing shareholders interest.
These schemes constitute plans allowing senior
executives to obtain shares of the company

3
usually at a reduced price, consequently aligning
financial interest of executives with those of
shareholders [15]. Apparently, transparency in
the form of increased corporate governance
disclosure is considered an important instrument
for aligning management and shareholders
interest [2]. Also, it serves as a means of
mitigating the information asymmetry that exist
between management and shareholders.
3. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IN
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
Developing countries, in particular, have been
warned of the consequences of adopting poor
corporate governance practices that may cause
the shares of businesses to be sold for billions of
dollars less than they ought to if their firms had
put in place good corporate governance
practices and policies [20]. The model of
corporate governance in developing countries
has embraced both market based and insider
approaches to corporate governance [21].
Privatization of government owned business
enterprises is one example of market based
corporate governance practices [12]. Of recent,
the increasing trend of privatization mantra has
followed decades of state ownership and control
of business enterprises [22]; a common
characteristic of most developing countries in
Africa. After the period of independence, state
ownership was done more as a sign of national
pride and sovereignty rather than any practical
economic considerations [23]. With the un-
sustainability of most state owned enterprises by
developing countries in Africa, most African
countries have carried out far reaching economic
reforms that has focused on privatizing most
government run state enterprises [24]. The role
of government in these countries has been
redefined to focus on creating and providing the
necessary infrastructure, enabling environment
and regulatory framework for corporate
governance firms and business enterprises to
thrive [25].
Also, a common feature of corporate governance
in developing countries is the inclination towards
an insider approach, with a prevalence of family
owned, closely guarded business enterprises
and the problems and issues that arise with
family oriented business structures [25]. The
board executives of most of these businesses
are filled with family members and close friends,
often times, none of them are qualified for
sensitive positions they occupy [26]. In a
business environment such as this, the
executives are more inclined to further their own
personal interest to the detriment of other critical
stakeholders and shareholders [27]. As a means
of checking the excesses of board members,
independent directors have been advocated as a
panacea to curb the improper executive action
[28]. However, in developing countries this is not
the case, as the business community can
regarded as quite small and also there is an
interlocking of personal and financial interests
[9]. In such developing countries, independence
directors are more likely to be rubber stamp, they
are incapable of acting as effective checks
against executive excesses [29]. The weak
nature of financial and capital market
infrastructure and poor legal enforcement
mechanisms implies that shareholder protection;
especially minority shareholders and property
rights of individual and corporations are not
effectively protected [30,21].
3.1 Corporate Governance in Nigeria and
South Africa
In Nigeria, corporate governance practices and
conduct has been characterized by endemic
corruption, poor transparency and disclosure
practices as well as significant political
interferences in corporate governance activities,
consequently distorting and undermining
corporate governance development [10,22,12]. In
recent times, ongoing corporate governance
reforms have been initiated to improve corporate
governance practices in Nigeria. Some of these
reforms include: 2003 Code of Conduct for
Corporate Governance, the 2006 mandatory
Code of Conduct for Nigerian Banks
post consolidation, the 2007 Code of Conduct
for Shareholders Association in Nigeria,
consolidation of Nigerian banks and the increase
in the minimum of capital base were all policy
reforms intended to strengthen corporate
governance practices in the state. These
measures were taken to prevent a repeat of the
incident that occurred recently, when several
banks were bailed out by the central bank of
Nigeria for inability to perform their banking
obligations as result of financial failure,
fraudulent activities by bank managers and
questionable business practices [31].
The story is South Africa is not entirely different.
Amongst emerging countries in the world, South
Africa stands out as a very interesting case in
which to examine how specific corporate
governance reforms have emerged or unfolded
[32]. [33] Identify a number of government

legislations that have been designed to influence
and strengthen corporate governance in South
Africa: The Companies Act, the Insider Trading
Act, the Public Finance Management Act and the
Securities Services Act. In addition, South Africa
initiated the publication of corporate governance
guidelines and codes of practice with the King
Report I, King Report II, and King Report III
instigating an unprecedented global interest in
corporate governance in Africa. In spite of
several comprehensive legislations corporate
governance reforms, South Africa has been
affected by major corporate governance failures
in recent years. The collapse of corporations
such as Macmed, Regal Treasury Bank and
Leisurenet are particularly significant [34]. In an
effort to reform and address peculiar corporate
governance problems in South Africa, [33]
recommend that the following issues need to be
resolved: intentional regulatory and bureaucratic
strangling of small and medium scale business
enterprise, addressing the problem of a weak,
incompetent and ineffective board structure and
also the issue of independence of board.
3.2 Research on Corporate Governance
Disclosure
Corporate governance disclosure practices do
not and cannot develop in a vacuum, [35]
maintain that the levels of corporate governance
disclosure tend to reflect the underlying
institutional and environmental influences that
affects managers and business firms in different
countries. There are a variety of environmental
factors that influence disclosure practices by
companies, they have been identified [36], and
these factors include regulatory framework,
capital markets, economy, enforcement
mechanisms and culture all form part of
environmental influences [37,3]. Most research
on corporate governance disclosure has focused
on disclosure issues of developing countries and
have been researched from an agency theory
perspective [38,13]. Again, agency theory
perspective has used transparency as a tool and
mechanism for aligning the interest shareholders
and management. The influence of corporate
governance disclosure has been examined at the
level of country [39] and also at the level of the
firm [40]. The extant research predicts that
the governance variables likely to influence
corporate governance disclosure can be
classified into two categories: External
governance mechanism in the form of political
institutions, legal system and freedom of the
press for the country-level studies [30,20]; and
internal governance mechanisms that involve
regulatory oversight, ownership concentration,
share ownership by directors and managers,
organizational structure of the corporation, and
costs of voluntary corporate governance
disclosure [41]. [42] examined corporate
governance disclosure in eight Canadian banks;
they categorized corporate governance
disclosure of the banks into the following
categories: Board structure and directors’ profile,
financial information and corporate information,
board independence and board committee,
corporate social responsibility disclosure,
information on website and remuneration of
board. They find that larger banks disclose more
information than small banks, the smaller banks
had less information on their websites. Also,
information on board structure and directors
profile was scanty and remuneration of board of
small banks was not as detailed as the larger
banks. The percentage scores for disclosure on
larger banks ranged between 96% to 91%. For
smaller banks, percentage scores ranged from
88% to 80%.
In developing countries, research on corporate
governance disclosure are few and have focused
on some of the following issues: overall levels
of disclosure using disclosure index extracted
from corporate governance literature, levels of
compliance with international standards and
domestic regulation, institutional factors that
hinder, constrain and hamper corporate
governance disclosure [43,29]. In general, the
research on corporate governance disclosure for
many developing countries reveals a low or
minimal level of disclosure [44].
Samaha et al. [11] assessed corporate
governance disclosure of Egyptian firms listed on
the Egyptian Stock Exchange (ESA) and they
find that the level of corporate governance
disclosure by Egyptian firms to be minimal,
however they also find that levels of disclosure of
corporate governance are high for items that are
considered mandatory under the Egyptian
Accounting Standard. They conclude that the
levels of corporate governance disclosure are
lower for companies with duality position and
levels of corporate governance disclosure
increases with the number of independent
directors on the board. [43] investigates the
extent to which Ghanaian firms comply with
international accounting standards and also the
levels of corporate governance disclosure. The
findings of the research reveal that most of the
firms listed in the Ghana stock exchange did not

overwhelmingly comply with international
accounting standard disclosure requirements.
The pioneering research on corporate
governance disclosure in Nigeria was done by
[37] he found that most of the companies in the
study a low level of corporate governance
disclosure with respect to balance sheet,
valuation method and historical items. However,
the companies did not adequately comply with
the disclosure requirements and also the levels
of corporate governance disclosure was poor, an
estimated 43.11%. A similar study on corporate
governance disclosure in South Africa was done
by [45] who did a comparative analysis of
corporate governance disclosure in South Africa
and the United Kingdom. For South African, the
study revealed low levels of disclosure for listed
South Africa firms and this was found to be
common with other studies done on corporate
governance disclosure in developing countries.
Although the findings are not encouraging, they
are consistent with [44,22] and who found similar
results with companies in other developing
countries.
3.3 Characteristics of the Banking Sector
in Nigeria and South Africa
Prior to the banking consolidation reforms in
2004, there were a total of 89 in Nigeria with a
total of 3200 deposit money banks (DMB) and
total employment in the sector has gone up from
about 55,000 before reforms to over 77,519
currently [46]. The banking consolidation
exercise by the Central Bank of Nigeria has
demanded that all deposit banks increase their
minimum capital base from US $15 million to US
$200 million by December, 2005. Banks that
failed to meet these new requirements were
expected to merge for failing to do so, and those
who failed to meet the new minimum capital base
requirements would have their license revoked.
According to [47] some of the constructive
reforms that have been put in place include:
recapitalization of banks to 25 billion naira
shareholder fund, zero tolerance of misreporting
and infractions, stricter enforcement of corporate
governance principles, stringent application of
the contingency planning framework for systemic
distress, closer collaboration with the Economic
and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in the
establishment of Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)
and enforcement of the anti-money laundering
measures and currency reforms. In actual fact,
these institutional reforms were constructed to
prevent the emergence of a banking crisis that
could result from inherently weak banks
characterized by persistent under capitalization,
high levels of non-performing loans, illiquidity,
insolvency, and poor corporate governance
practices [48].
As of December 2013, the Nigerian Banking
Industry is comprised of 20 domestic banks and
4 foreign banks. The six tier-one banks (Zenith
Bank, United Bank for Africa, Access Bank, First
Bank, Equatorial Trust Bank, and Guarantee
Trust Bank) account for 70% of the industry’s’
total assets of $136 billion as at December 2012.
The other banks (18 in number) hold less than
35% of total assets. For that reason, it should not
come as a surprise that research on the Nigerian
banking industry focuses on the 5 leading banks.
According to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN),
Nigerian banks operate through an extensive
network that includes over 5,585 DMBs and
close to 12,755 automated banking machines
(ABMs) across the country. In total these
financial institutions have over 136 billion dollars
in assets, which represent a 300.5% increase in
assets within seven year of the banking
consolidation [48].
In comparison, South African banks appears to
have a better developed and more robust
banking infrastructure than Nigerian Banks, they
have a have large sophisticated financial
structure and a highly competitive banking
industry which is dominated by both local and
foreign banks. The total financial sector asset
is estimated 298 percent of GDP and it exceeds
those of most developing economies.
Commercial banks assets alone are an
estimated 112 percent of GDP, while the
insurance sector gross asset is 67 percent of
GDP. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB)
maintain that total banking sector asset recorded,
on the average, an annual growth rate of 7.2
percent during a three year period (2011-2014)
and reaching US $362 billion by December of
2014. On the whole, Southern African banks are
well capitalized, and more often than not have
lower non-performing loan ratios in comparison
to the other developing countries.
In South Africa, there are 31 registered banks,
this comprises of 17 South African Banks, 14
foreign banks, and 3 mutual banks. Also, 41
international banks have authorized
representative offices in South Africa; however,
these representative offices do not collect
financial deposits. Five major commercial banks
continue to dominate the South African banking
