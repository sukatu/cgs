Corporate governance developments in Ghana: the past,
the present and the future
Abstract
Corporate governance has received a lot of attention after the 2008 global credit crunch that culminated into bank fail-
ures and worldwide economic crises. In many developing countries, disclosures and the compliance with the corporate
governance codes of best practices existing in such countries have become necessary due to ever increasing foreign
investors who rely upon the financial reports of companies in those countries before having huge economic and finan-
cial investments in them.
In the case of Ghana, following the enactments of the 2002 corporate governance code by the SEC, many codes of best
practices have emanated while there have been calls for a single code by various regulators and stakeholders. While
full compliance with the codes and its enforcement by the SEC is being canvassed for, corruption which has persisted
and continues to grow has been single out as the major bane within the Ghanaian system. This paper, however, contri-
butes to a body of knowledge and existing literatures while giving a lucid picture as to the corporate governance devel-
opments in Ghana in the past, the present and the future. It discusses the issue of compliance with the codes of best
practices and the challenges being faced in a developing economy such as Ghana. It argues that while the socio-cultural
problem of corruption persists, it is onerous on the government to fight through good governance, effective legal sys-
tem, proper enforcement by the regulators and citizenship enlighten.

Introduction
Corporate Governance systems have evolved over
centuries, often in response to corporate failures or
systemic crises. The first well-documented failure
of governance was the South Sea bubble 1 in the
1700s, which revolutionized business law and
practices in England. Similarly, much of the securi-
ties laws in the US were put in place following the
stock market crash of 1929 (Borgia, 2005). How-
ever, the subject of corporate governance in many

1 Popular name in England for the speculation in the South Sea Corpora-
tion, which failed disastrously in 1720. The corporation was formed in
1711 by Robert Harley, who needed allies to carry through peace negoti-
ations to end the War of the Spanish Succession. Holders of ȳ9 million
worth of government bonds were allowed to exchange their bonds for
stock (with 6% interest) in the new corporation, which was given a
monopoly of British trade with the islands of the South Seas and South
America. The monopoly was based on the expectation of securing
extensive trading concessions from Spain in the peace treaty. These
concessions barely materialized, however, so that the corporation had a
very shaky commercial basis. Nonetheless, it was active financially, and
in 1720 it proposed that it should assume responsibility for the entire
national debt, again offering its own stock in exchange for government
bonds, a transaction on which it expected to make a considerable profit.
The government accepted this proposal, and the result was an incredible
wave of speculation, which drove the price of the corporation’s stock
from ȳ1281/2 in January 1720, to ȳ1000 in August. Many dishonest and
imprudent speculative ventures sprang up in imitation. In September
1720, the bubble bust. Banks failed when they could not collect loans on
inflated stock, prices of stock fell, thousands were ruined (including
many members of the government), and fraud in the South Sea Corpora-
tion was exposed. Robert Walpole became first lord of the treasury and
Chancellor of the Exchequer and started a series of measures to restore
the credit of the corporation and to reorganize it. The busting of the
bubble, which coincided with the similar collapse of the Mississippi
Scheme in France, ended the prevalent belief that prosperity could be
achieved through unlimited expansion of credit. Legislation was enacted
that forbade unincorporated joint stock enterprise (Borgia, 2005).
other developed markets in the late 1900’s received
serious attention after some corporate and business
collapses such as Parmalat and Enron cases which
are attributed to poor governance practices. This
development was accelerated with the onset of the
Asian crisis in mid-1997 and the early 2000 glob-
al financial crisis that started out in the US hous-
ing market, causing global economic contagion
(Ghana SEC, 2002).
Interestingly, corporate governance in the develop-
ing economies also received a lot of attention within
the last decade (Oman, 2001; Goswami, 2001; Lin,
2001; Malherbe and Segal, 2001). Corporate gover-
nance developments in Ghana has however taken an
interesting dimension with the introduction of 2002
Code of best practices by SEC; as well as many
other guidelines by all other agencies.
While the subject has taken on international dimen-
sions, due to the globalization of the economies and
the financial investment markets, many multilateral
agencies has continued to encourage governments,
regulators and organizations to examine the subject
closely and to take proactive steps to introduce and
implement proper corporate governance procedures.
Thus, many of these agencies either individually or
collectively issued codes containing the general
principles upon which acceptable corporate gover-
nance frameworks should be based. Notably
amongst these are the codes and principles issued by
organizations such as the Organization for Econom-
ic Co-operation and Development and the Com-
monwealth Association for Corporate Governance
(Ghana SEC, 2002).

1. What is corporate governance?
A shared definition of corporate governance which
is both valuable and consistent has not been easy to
find (Borga, 2005), because every economy and
country has different systems of corporate gover-
nance that differ to each other in accordance to the
strength, power and influence being exercised by
their various stakeholders and management. Fur-
thermore, different socio-economic, legal, political
and cultural systems existing in each country do
have relevant influences on corporate governance
(Okike, 2007). That is why the use of the clause:
there is “no one size fit all” approach in corporate
governance is prevalently being used. Nevertheless,
the objectives of corporate governance share com-
mon denominator worldwide.
However, few definitions from various bodies shall
be considered in this piece.
The Ghanaian Securities and Exchange Commission
defined corporate governance in 2002 as “the man-
ner in which corporate bodies are managed and
operated”.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD)1 however defines it (corpo-
rate governance) as a set of relationships governing
the various members of a corporation. It is further
defined by the OECD (1999) as the system by which
business corporations are directed and controlled.
It specifies the distribution rights and responsibili-
ties among different participants in a corporation,
such as: the board, managers, shareholders and
other stakeholders while spelling out the rules and
procedure for making decisions on corporate af-
fairs. By doing this, it provides the structure through
which the objectives are set and the means of attain-
ing those objectives and performances monitoring.
1 Pursuant to Article 1 of the Convention signed in Paris on December
14, 1960, and which came into force on September 30, 1961, the Organ-
ization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shall
promote policies designed: (1) to achieve the highest sustainable eco-
nomic growth and employment and a rising standard of living in member
countries, while maintaining financial stability, and thus to contribute to
the development of the world economy; (2) to contribute to sound
economic expansion in member as well as non-member countries in the
process of economic development; and (3) to contribute to the expan-
sion of world trade on a multilateral, non-discriminatory basis in accor-
dance with international obligations, OECD (2004).
The original member countries of the OECD are Austria, Belgium,
Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. The
following countries became members subsequently through accession at
the dates indicated hereafter: Japan (April 28, 1964), Finland (January
28, 1969), Australia (June 7, 1971), New Zealand (May 29, 1973),
Mexico (May 18, 1994), the Czech Republic (December 21, 1995),
Hungary (May 7, 1996), Poland (November 22, 1996), Korea (Decem-
ber 12, 1996) and the Slovak Republic (December 14, 2000). The
Commission of the European Communities takes part in the work of the
OECD (Article 13 of the OECD Convention).
2. Corporate governance developments (the past)
The corporate governance developments and disclo-
sures in any country are often shaped by a wide
array of internal as well as external factors (Okike,
2007). Accordingly, the internal factors include the
state of the economy and the capital market, corpo-
rate and business culture, the legal system, govern-
ment policies, professional/regulatory bodies, amongst
others while the external factors (such as the old
colonial ties, membership of international account-
ing standard committee, direct foreign investment
activities of multinationals such as foreign banks
and companies) contribute considerably, if not total-
ly, to the complex reality of corporate governance
development in any developing country. The im-
pact of these factors and the differences in the sys-
tem operating within each country are well docu-
mented in the accounting and corporate governance
literatures (see Rose and Meyer, 2003; Okike, 2007
amongst others).
Traces of the corporate governance root in Ghana
can be traced to its companies’ laws right from the
colonial days. The regulation, control and gover-
nance of business enterprises in Ghana as of
present, are largely contained within the provisions
of the company legislation which has its root in
Ghana’s colonial past. Like most other former Brit-
ish colonies, Ghana inherited, at independence,
many rules and regulations left behind by the co-
lonial government. During the colonial period, Brit-
ish company legislation was introduced into the
country; hence Ghana’s legal system and corporate
governance practices mirrored the UK pattern
(Okike, 2007).
Prior to the independence, foreigners, mostly Brit-
ish, controlled the activities of business enterprises
in many of their old colonies and thus bring along
with them their economic interest and their (British)
legislation. In brief, the Ghanaian Companies Code,
1963 (Act 179) is based largely on the English
Companies Act of 1948 (Adda and Hinson, 2006).
Although the Code has seen no major changes since
the enactment and many attempts at revising it have
mainly been mere editorial changes, these historical
analysis, therefore, confirms and suggest that the
Ghanaian system of corporate governance is essen-
tially an “Anglo-Saxon”, or the “outsider control
system” (Franks and Meyer, 1994), and is a reflec-
tion of its colonial heritage (Okike, 2007).
Ghana SEC (2002) identified some common ele-
ments that underlie good corporate governance upon
which further evolution and developments in gover-
nance structures are built upon today. They are: (1)
the rights of shareholders; (2) the equitable treat-
ment of shareholders; (3) the roles of stakeholders;
