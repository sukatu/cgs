ABSTRACT
This paper examined the effect of corporate governance structures on the market value of firms in Ghana. Quantitative data was collected on thirty-
one firms listed on the Ghana stock exchange from 2009 to 2018 to predict the effect of corporate governance structures on the firm’s market value.
Panel data regression analysis revealed that corporate governance structures accounted for 84.9% of the variation of a firm’s market value for the
period. Furthermore, the study revealed a significant relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) duality, non-executive director, board size
and firm’s profitability and value. The study concludes that firms should separate CEO position from board chairman position to enhance a firm’s
profitability and value.

1. INTRODUCTION
Corporate governance is a process by which organisations are
directed, controlled and held to account to the stakeholders
of firm (Guo et al., 2013). It is a formal distribution of power
between three main parties: The board of directors, managers and
shareholders to ensure that the decisions of management do not
conflict with the shareholder interest (Ngoungo, 2012). Corporate
governance is an attempt to minimise the problems associated
with agency theory. The conflict between principal and agents due
to the separation and control of a firm by owners and managers
is commonly referred to as principal-agent problems (Byrmes
et al., 2003). The issue of corporate governance arises because of
the separation between the ownership and management of a firm.
This creates a problem commonly referred to as “principal-agent”
problem where management pursue their personal interest at the
expense of owners’ interest. The investors provide the capital
necessary to run the firm while managers manage and control
the firm to achieve the objective of the investors. Some of the
agency problems are the perks, executive pay, empire building and
risk- shifting and others. Although the principal-agent problems
have existed since the industrial revolution, business and political
leaders around the world had a re-awakening following fraudulent
business manoeuvres by the former energy giant, Enron, Inc.,
which eventually created financial crisis in the United States of
America (U.S.A).
Corporate governance failures were accounted for the collapse
of well performing firms in the past: Enron, Xerox, Parmalat,
WorldCom among others (Adewale, 2013; Angelides and Thomas,
2011; Badele and Fundeanu, 2014; Kasum and Etudaiye-Muthar,
2014; Ogujiuba and Obiechina, 2011; Oyerinde, 2014). Agency
problems have received lot of attention after the 2008 global
credit crunch that culminated into bank failures and worldwide
economic crises. Since then many multinational agencies have
encouraged governments, regulators and firms to examine the
subject matter closely to take proactive steps to implement
proper corporate governance procedures. These have seen many
countries sanctioning their own corporate governance systems:

U.S.A., the Cadbury Committee (1991) in the U.K., the Combined
Code (1998) by the London Stock Exchange, OECD principles on
Corporate Governance (1999), the Sarbanese Oxley Act (2002)
in the U.S.A., the J.J. Irani Committee (2004) in India. These
legislations were enacted to tighten the maintenance of internal
control systems, impose external constraints to curb the tendency
of the agents (i.e., managers) to act in ways that benefit their
personal interest instead of the interest of the firms they represent.
The recent banking crisis in Ghana has been partly due to the
absence of good corporate governance structures which has
led to purchase and assumption of seven banks other financial
institutions authorised by the Bank of Ghana. This has brought
corporate governance to the fore once again and continues to be
a concern to both academics and practitioners because it affects
the market value of firms. However, the empirical evidence on
the effect of corporate governance on a firm’s market value is mix
and unclear. This has generated a renewed interest especially in
the developing economies such as Ghana where the development
of corporate governance structures has been done in a piecemeal
approach without a national perspective. Listed firms in Ghana
have separate corporate governance guidelines while other
businesses are governed by the Companies Code 1963 (Act 179).
Good corporate governance creates the platform for the board and
executive managers to pursue goals which are in harmony with the
company objectives. Examples in Ghana include the enactments
of the 2002 corporate governance code by the SEC, Banking Act
2004 amended in 2007, 2016 and recent amendments in 2018
following the 2018 banking crisis. A good corporate mechanism
instituted either within a corporate establishment or in the larger
economic setting, yields the level of confidence needed for the
optimal operation of the economy. Conyon and He (2014) and
Ueng (2016) have suggested that financial scandals and corporate
dysfunctional behaviour have their roots in weak corporate
governance systems. Corporate governance failures result in
incompetence, poor organisational culture, and leadership styles
that are excessively focused on the short-term profit, excessive
risk-taking, and the pursuit of self-interest by managers (Zona,
2016). O’Connor and Byrne (2015) and Rashid (2015) traced the
challenges in a firm’s profitability and value to poor corporate
governance systems and weak and ineffective enforcement of
corporate governance standards by the board of directors.
2. LITERATURE REVIEW
The section reviews literature underpinning corporate governance
practices and firms’ profitability and value. The major concern
of corporate governance is how structures and processes used
by management affect the market value of a firm. The section is
organised into: Theoretical review and empirical review.
2.1. Theoretical Review
Two main theories that underline corporate governance are the
agency theory and stewardship theory. Agency theory relates
to management ethics while stewardship is concern with the
formation of social culture in a firm. The reviews provide in-depth
correlation between these two theories to corporate governance
and firm’s performance.
2.1.1. Agency theory
Jensen and Meckling (1976) presented the agency theory as
a theoretical basis of corporate governance, which identifies
governance mechanisms that can minimises the conflict of interests
resulting from the separation of ownership and management of
a firm’s resources. Agency theory is based on the relationship
between the principals (i.e., owners) and agents (i.e., managers)
in which the agents carry out the firm’s activities on behalf of
the owners. An agency problem arises when there is imperfect
alignment of interest between the principal and the agent. The
wealth and welfare of shareholders and other stakeholders are not
maximised in the event of conflict of interest between the two.
Agency theory is based on the separation of ownership and control
of firm by the principals (i.e., owners) and agents (i.e., managers).
The theory assumes that owners engage managers in order for the
managers to maximise the interest of the owners. On the contrary,
managers rather maximise their personal interest at the expense of
the owners’ interest (Sila et al., 2016). Agency theory arises due
to the separation of owners from management (Ali, 2014). The
theory opines that it is impossible for managers to act on behalf of
the owners without conflict of interest. Often, the managers make
decisions that are not in the best interest of the owners as they may
succumb to self-interest, opportunistic behaviour and fall short of
expectations of the owners. Managers will prefer to invest free cash
flow into a new project rather than pay dividend to shareholders
in order to expand and grow their firms (MacCarthy and Ahulu,
2019). Sometimes, managers are motivated to borrow to expand
and grow the business not because it is the best decision for the
firm but because they want to boost their personal career growth.
These debts can create high cost to the firm and sometimes result
in financial distress, leading to bankruptcy at the expense of the
owners. This implies that managers sometimes take excessive
risk to borrow and buy assets to expand the firm at the expense
of the owners. Agency theory creates the problem of information
asymmetry, adverse selection, and moral hazard in that order.
2.1.1.1. Information asymmetry
This is a challenge that arises where agency problem exists and
occurs when a firm’s internal information is controlled by managers
to the extent that managers have too much or little information on
the firm (Dahlstrom and Persson, 2010). Information asymmetry
makes owners unable to take appropriate decisions on the firm.
Owners are unable to take appropriate decisions on the firm where
information asymmetry exist. Tsai (2008) states that the higher
the information asymmetry the greater the uncertainty of owners
are, concerning the firm and its growth prospects.
2.1.1.2. Adverse selection
This situation arises from information asymmetry where managers
of a firm make wrong choices or fail to make the best choices for
the firm due to their personal interest.
2.1.1.3. Moral hazard
This situation follows after information asymmetry and adverse
selection. Moral hazard arises when managers do not take the
full consequences and responsibilities of their actions, hence
acting less carefully than they otherwise would, and leaving
responsibility of the consequences of their actions on another party.
