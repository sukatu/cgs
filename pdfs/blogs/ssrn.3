Corporate Governance under the South African Companies
Act: A Critique
Linda Muswaka
Corporate governance in South Africa has traditionally been based on the shareholder
value approach. In terms of this approach, directors are expected to manage a company
in the best interests of the shareholders collectively. This approach is however,
increasingly being questioned. With the surge of interest in the recognition of not only
shareholder interests, but also the interests of other stakeholders, the corporate
governance approach in South Africa merits a deeper analysis. This paper critiques the
corporate governance approach under the Companies Act 71 of 2008. The main concern
is whether the Companies Act gives recognition to a broader spectrum of stakeholders
and whether it reflects the new thinking in corporate governance. The investigation
identifies the lacuna in the law and makes recommendations for reform. The findings of
this paper will be of benefit to the legislators, directors, shareholders and all other
stakeholders.

1. Introduction
It is trite law that a director owes a duty to act bona fide in the best interests of the
company in which he or she is involved.1 However, the main question that follows from
a duty formulated in this manner is what constitutes ‘the best interests of the company?’
Different theories such as the shareholder value theory, the stakeholder theory and the
enlightened shareholder value theory have all been developed to address this question.
In this paper, the development of the corporate governance debate in South Africa in
the context of the shareholder value approach, the stakeholder approach, and
proposals by the Corporate Regulation Division of the Department of Trade and Industry
during the company law reform process for the adoption of the enlightened shareholder
value approach will be discussed. Further, the paper concentrates on section 76(3)(b) of
the Companies Act 71 of 2008 which is the key provision in highlighting the interests to
considered by directors when managing companies. It also discusses sections 7, 20(4),
144, 145, 162(2), 165(2) and 218(2) which are all relevant when determining the
recognition of stakeholder interests in the Companies Act.
2. Literature Review
Literature highlighting the importance of the recognition of a wider variety of interests
that should be considered in addition to those of the shareholders has been growing

over the last many years. Several contributions note that while the traditional view holds
that the function of directors is none other than that of profit maximization for the
shareholders, there has been a shift in public opinion towards the recognition of the
interests of a broader spectrum of stakeholders (Esser, 2009; Esser, 2005; Havenga,
2005; Mongalo, 2003; Rossouw, van der Watt and Malan, 2002; Shandu, 2005). There
is mounting pressure on directors to take into account not only shareholder interests
when they manage a company, but rather the interests of all stakeholders, such as
employees, creditors, consumers, suppliers, the environment and the community (Esser
and Du Plessis, 2007). It has been stated that corporate governance involves the
balancing of the interests of all internal stakeholders and other parties who can be
affected by the corporation’s conduct (Benade et al, 2008). The King Reports on
Corporate Governance for South Africa also place strong emphasis on the protection of
stakeholder interests. However, South African commentators (Botha, 1996; Spisto,
2005) argue that the King Reports are not sufficiently clear on the preferred approach
on the protection of the interests of stakeholders.
While the previous studies cited above have shown that stakeholder interests are now
important factors to which company management must have regard to, the focus has
been mainly on the King Reports. The issue whether the Companies Act, 2008 gives
recognition to a broader spectrum of stakeholders and reflects the new thinking in
corporate governance has not received much attention among researchers. Moving
beyond prior literature, this study therefore, provides a critical analysis of the corporate
governance approach in South Africa as reflected in the Companies Act.
3. Research Methodology
The qualitative research method has been employed in this study. The main methods
associated with qualitative research are participant observation, qualitative interviewing,
and the collection and qualitative analysis of texts and documents (Welman, Kruger and
Mitchell, 2006). The research method used in this study is the collection and qualitative
analysis of texts and documents. The research is mainly analytical and critical in nature.
In the context of this study, an analytical approach enables one to gain a deeper
understanding of the corporate governance approach in South Africa. The critical
approach seeks to identify the lacuna in the law.
4. The Company Law Reform Process
In May 2004, the Corporate Regulation Division of the Department of Trade and
Industry commenced with the reform of the national corporate law by issuing a Policy
Document on the guidelines for corporate law review.2 The Policy Document dealt with
the scope of company law in Chapter 3. It started by acknowledging the fact that every
company law reform process begins with the fundamental question, ‘in whose interests
should the corporation be run?’3 The Policy Document discussed the enlightened
shareholder value approach and the pluralist approach, the latter essentially providing
